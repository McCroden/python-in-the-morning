Man Page Monday
===============

A focus on reading documentation and understanding the basic tools of our programming language, shell, operating system.

Every Monday we will focus on 3 Topics:
- A Python Module from the Standard Library
- One or more bash commands
- Some documentation on the Arch Wiki

These 3 things will not just be Python, Bash, Arch Linux specific, we will be trying to understand other ways things are done, and gather viewer experience.
