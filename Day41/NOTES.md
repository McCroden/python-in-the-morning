Career Path:
	- Work Fang for a couple years

Heres the Book: Cracking the Coding Interview
	- 60 pages on Big O notation.


We should not learn for Coding Interviews:
	- We should learn to solve problems
  - To have fun

You master the coding interview, and end up not finding the
right mix for you. For me personally, the interview style of the company,
is helping me know if I want to work there.

so we can a junior salary.

You say yes, because you're newer and want a job.

You say sorry thats not going to work for me.

In India:
---
This allow companies to exploit employees to keep their
salaries low.

they will ask u to show salary slips before job. so u cant lie
Are you allowed to share you salaries with coworkers?
#talkpay movement

Companies will just tell you a lie (some person at the company), and it's your job to know the law.


Company: "You can't share you salary"
Me: "Not uh"
Company: "We need to see payslips"
Me: "Not uh"
Me: "Biiiiish"





At minimum, new computer every year.
GAS -> Gear!!!

TODO:
=====
  * Change Bitrate to 2500
	* Make it so you change hue lights with begin bux,
    commands
	* Start making youtube playlists




Viewer Questions
================
	PandaPersonTTV: can u make beautiful websites using flask ?

	Flask can be your API decoupled from your frontend


In AWS:
EC2 instance -> running a Flask App
API Gateway / ALB -> routing to that that EC2 Flask App
Frontend Code hosted in an S3 Bucket wrapped in a CDN
Talking back to those APIs

You can server frontend requests as well, and pull in JS to do whatever you want.
More to setup, more minimal at first.

Django -> Monolithic Application, more often frontend and backend
Flask  -> Many Flask Apps, often just APIs, more micro-service



Questions
=========
	* what does exponential distribution mean??
	* How does one generate the Time elapsed between Trips in a DES simuluation
    using an exponential distribution????

Learnings
=========
	* Priority queue

	* Constructor for a priority queue. maxsize is an integer that sets the upperbound limit on the number of items that can be placed in the queue. Insertion will block once this size has been reached, until queue items are consumed. If maxsize is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is infinite.

Ponderings
==========

PandaPerson: Can't find jobs in backend stuff

One Trick to Breaking into the Backend (That Frontend Developers don't want you to know!!)
---
	* You can get hired for frontend and just do backend and never stop.


Haze: frontend is a good place to cut your teeth anyway
Begin: Maybe Disagree, everything changes every six months these days.


Begin's General Advice:
	* Don't do something you don't like hoping it will lead to something you like.
		Do the thing you like now, and wait.



You are a new graduate, you a code school graduate, career changer looking for first job.
Where ever you go first, IS going to have a profound impact on you and your career.

3 People all looking for thier first Coding Job:
	- I don't have enough experience, so I will take a QA Job
		- Never move into dev, end up doing manual QA,
      hate it, quit, now trying to get a real estate license
	- Not enough Backend, I will take a Frontend Job
		- learning more frontend, get promoted frontend,
      hate frontend, want to switch to backend,
      but now because of life, can't handle the salary cut.

Two Options to Get into Data Science:
	- College, get a degree
	√ Begin's Suggestion: Teach yourself


I don't care if you can pass college
I care if you can solve problems on your own,
teach yourself on your own
complete things on your own
make smart decisions with money


sweeku: i think entry pos for data science is very competitive right now

Begin's Maybe Made Up Opinion:
	- we had a Big Data, big data gonan be crucnehd to make us cash
  - bunch of people went to school got degrees, hit the workfore
	- guess what they don't know how to use data to make monye
		there are jobs where tihs is real, but it ain't company.



Data Scientist: 
	Why do you want to be a Data Scientist?

The otherside of Data-Science:
	- all day you spend santizing and organizing data, to then run an experiment.


Just start AI right now.

### This heirachy is confusing:

Iterators
v
Generators
v
CoRoutines

Opinions
========

HazeAnderson: my advice is don't let them get to the point where they give you an offer then ....
	before you reject.
	When you know you are not going to proceed, its probably good to
  tell them soon.

Company Perspective
---
	* Dear lord, do you know how hard it is to hire someone, and
    the annoyingness of having an offer out and having to put
    other interviewees on hold.


Interviewer Perspective
---
	* We don't know if the offer is gonna be bananas
	* It's good experience and info to see to the end

Begin: Offer shouldn't come in blind
			- before we got to offer, i will have talked about the range
        and what im looking for.

Quotes
======
	“When the iterator is another generator, the effect is the same as if the body of the subgenerator were inlined at the point of the yield from expression. Furthermore, the subgenerator is allowed to execute a return statement with a value, and that value becomes the value of the yield from expression.”
	- Greg Ewing
