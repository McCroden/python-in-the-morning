## A List of Opinions about Code that I have realized and recorded on Stream


Steps to Embracing Python:
	- Stop saying Array, say List
		unless you are explicitly talking about a python array
	- Drop postfix conditionals when working in Python
		- I've heard pythonistas say they are confusing or not explicit


I HATE I HATE A HATE PRE COMMIT HOOKS
	- Within Github or Gitlab run those things.
	- You always end up using `-n, --no-verify`
	- If you want developrs to not commit
    untested or formatter code, then have the CI Pipeline
    do that. Github Actions.
