## A List of Opinions about Code that I have realized and recorded on Stream


Steps to Embracing Python:
	- Stop saying Array, say List
		unless you are explicitly talking about a python array
	- Drop postfix conditionals when working in Python
		- I've heard pythonistas say they are confusing or not explicit


I HATE I HATE A HATE PRE COMMIT HOOKS
	- Within Github or Gitlab run those things.
	- You always end up using `-n, --no-verify`
	- If you want developrs to not commit
    untested or formatter code, then have the CI Pipeline
    do that. Github Actions.



Learning Python Advice:

> SketchyScripts: Small scope, high stakes


I. Pick a project, that will make you money or for a hobby you already do
II. Set a deadline and share it with people on that date
III. exploring the interwebs and meetups and books to HELP YOU finish your project


How do you come up with stuff that makes money?
  Time == Money
  Save yourself time.

Start thinking like a programmer, what can I automate.

New Programmer Brainwashing:
  * Constantly, could a computer do this for me???
  * what do you do somewhat frequently that annoys you? - stupac
  * that sounds like the job of a computer







I always save these emails once a week on this drive.





Steps to finding automation in your life:
  * Record what your doing over a week
  * Look at your job, and see what parts you already use a computer for
    can those be automated more
  * What are things that I'm NOT using a computer, maybe we need a computer
    in the mix.




Database Advice:
================
	* Learn the common patterns for normalizing data in a relational manner
	* Query the DB with SQL and not just through your language
	* Have fun
	* SQL skills are going to lead to a job probably faster
	* NoSQL are needed, but a little rarer, but if you are new and find a company
    who helps help in that part. Mongo, and you only Mongo, you might get hired
