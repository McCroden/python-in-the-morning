=============

Bounty:
=======
	* Can you exit a loop early and still get an else statement to run?

Goals
=====
  * Learn about Python Context Managers
  * Admit when when we don't know basic concepts
  * Dive down Rabbit Holes
  * Viewer Code Review
  * Ponder Life and Code Questions
  * Have Fun

Viewer Questions

Questions
=========
	* Why does everyone say not to use else after while and for
		Reasons Against:
			- It's wierd
			- it is different semantics than if/else
			- Not everyone knows what it means
		Reasons For:
			- Cleaner Code?


Should we not use a feature, because its named:
	* Poorly
	* Confusingly
	* Dumb


Language:
	* Python
			- else - for, while, try
	* Ruby
			-
	* Javascript
			- 
	* Java
			- 
	* Rails
			- ActiveRecord is not the ActiveRecord Pattern



Learnings
=========
  * for, while, and try all can use else

  * Inside a breakpoint(), type `interact`
    then you're in a non-pdb shell, so you can use all the cool
    single variable letter names you want

Ponderings
==========
	* Do we like then better than else?
		Wheres the PEP for then?
		What other languages use then?
		What about different keywords, for try, while, and for!??

else is typically villan,
if code is story
if is when things go good.
else if a little brother if,
so it always second class

while, for, try. Its actually a bonus method
and indicator went right, you get

while is the complicated version,
because like break, causes you not to hit else
however, if the statement becomes falsify.

what is success to a while statement,
running for a bit, becoming falsy and moving on.
otherwise we have infinite loop
else is still about success.

Opinions
========
  * If and especially else is kinda of code smell
    My Goal: Write no ifs if possible
