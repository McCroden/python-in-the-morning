(2020) - 2 - 9
============

Goals
=====
- Learn some things
- Have fun
- Learn how to use my new computer




Dumbest Begin Dreams:
---
  - can I stream from one computer, of another computer boot from an ISO
  - everyday, I want to start installing a fresh arch linux
    - Speed Running: Arch Linux Installs
  - only what I need that day
  - wipe at the end of the day
  - Wake up, make a cup of coffee, and partitioning your harddrive.



Dynamic Programming Cavet
---
- When methods are dynamic, you can't search their implementation
-











Subgoals
--------
- Setup vim and neovim
- setup tmux
- terminal looking how I want
- fix copy and paste problems
- learn how to use all the larbs
- i3
- try Qtile
- obs streamdeck doesn't work
- get the ergodox setup and working
- sent
- the rest of suckless
- ensure my bootloading is proper
- gnu stow
- all my dotfiles
- website logins
- Setting up Scenes
- symlink .vimrc to .config/nvim/init.vim
-

xrandr - for handling multiple
look up the HDMI and Siplay Port and then tell xrandr, hey this Display[ort
is left of the HDMI


Begin Setting up Arch
----



use 720p60 and 5000 bitrate then ur quality will be amazing

Then just install qtile with pacman and lightdm will likely recognize it automatically










Dream Terminal Setup
---
- Darker still a little transparent, video of whales playing the background



Stream Elements:
----------------,
- why would I want an overlay?
  - starting stream and ending, brb



Philsophy Change
---
- used to use tmux, now full i3

Browser
-------
- surf
- lynx qutebrowser


Why are you soo bad?
---
- Built a new PC
- Switched to Arch
- LARBs - Luke smiths auto Ricing Scripts



### How to Learn to more important than Knowledge
How do we learn Better
---
- record our assumptions
- record what we are confused about
- repeat often over and over again, in different variations, to make it permanent.

Learning to Program is like learning an instrument.
Example a lick:
 - you learn a lick slow
 - you repeat a lot
 - you slowly speed it up
 - you try it in different variations
 - you play a version of a song where its mostly just that lick
 - you play it in every key
 - you play half of it

You are trying to get the lick, to no longer be a concious choice, its a fluid tool,
that you can pull out any time.

Learning Technique:
---
- Hackting
  - pretend its the future and you are talking to someone else.



You goals have to achievable:
- Learn how to create frameworks and abstractions is too generic
- better: create mini web framework, create test framework


- what are the big categories of frameworks in python:
- what are the implementations
- what are the differences
- what are the commonalities




# Beginner 4 Lyfe


# Beginners get all the advantages:
Begin Advice: Never let anyone know you know anything
  - If you don't know, no one looks down on you
  - if you do know, they are like wow I thought you dumb!!
Thats called a win-win.



instance method
	- on the instance, takes self as the first arg
class method
	- on the class, takes cls as the first arg
	- when do you use this: Alternative constructors
static method
	- takes neither instance or class, but is called on the class,
	- When do you use this: like a singleton method
	- something that doesn't operate on state




Young Thug Lessons:
- I had to work a lot for this
- you didn't see the work
- Im still a beginner and this is only the beginning




You don't have to get paid to code, to code, everyone can


Vertical



Installed Arch on System:
====
- Failed 5 times
- Read docs for an hour
- two commands
- Read docs for another hour














Great thing to do when you build a computer:
---
- read about mac specs and then look the price.

## The Switch Arch
since im Vim/Tmux/Bash it helped the transition some.





TODO
----
- Update my stream info, to reflect my new computer

Viewer Questions
================
- Is there a way to know what cookies are needed in order to get valid results?
   - will an API tell you what cookies it needs?
   - Begin Thinks no?
   - trick the website and since we are tricking


- would init be called a Factory? from deisgn patterns

We call __init__ a constructor, however this isn't technically true.


__init__ doesn't create the object,
it receives the created object
from __new__
and then it does some stuff with it,
and doesn't return
actual object creation is in __new__



Honest question about qtile.. What's the best way to overwrite some class? I want to change the images shown by this widget class.. Do I inherit from the class and just overwrite the function I want to change?

Begin Opinions:
- You shouldn't just overwrite the function:

Options:
  - inheritance
  - does Qtile provide a way of extending?

Inheritence Rules:
 - Keep it one level
 - Use all the methods of the class





If you hate websites and all their fancy JS:
- use NO JS, disable javascript
- one day where everyone turns off JS, and then get on twitter, be in that chat box on the site, reach out to support, hey your website doesn't at all without Javascript.





Questions
=========
- What does the Uniform access prinicpal give us??
- Why do you need a Warnings library?
  - could a warnings library

Learnings
=========

This agrees with the Uniform access principle:

All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through computation.

If you are someone and you want to follow the Uniform access principal:
someone asks you something, you can't let them know if you already knew the answer,
or you looked it up.

Example: Stack Overflow
- Someone asks you a question on Stack Overflow
- you don't let them know if you alredy knew or

Example for an instance of class:
- someone passes a message, hey name
  - you don't let the person who asked, know whether it was a method
  - or a attribute




Ponderings
==========

Opinions
========

Debates
=======
- Whats it the best name (bonus: and syntax), for a key and value data structure:
  - python - dict
    - hard to say without people laughing at you
  - ruby - hash
     - hash means soo many things
  - javascript - object?
  - some language say map?


How Begin Made Money Programming:
---
- tell people I program and can build websites
- someone asks you to build a site with X features
- open up Railscasts, see if theres an episode about it
  - paypal
  - twitter integration
  - email marketing
  - if yes
- Of course I can build that and charge money, learn, build site
- repeat


Bounty
---
- Whats the best way to explain ABCs to someone?

<LeftMouse>bzzzt_bzzzt: your doctor says you have to do 30mins of PhysiclActivity a day, to implement that you have to figure out what physical activity you are gonna do, is it walking? is it a soccer? implementing PhysicalActivity is the abstract base class and soccer or walking is the actual implementation


Voting:
- PhysicalActivity
- JobDescription

### Write a function that uses everyword, in the most minimal example.
### Write that "brown fox sentence"

This sentence contains every letter:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

Make a function that contains everykeyword:{

```
keyword.kwlist
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']
```

Is there a lanugage philsopy of: if its here, might as well use that use that too?


Common occurance:
- Joins, looks for a second, hey use this


How did I choose vim:
===
- Vim is on every server
- vim ain't changing
- something I can invest years into
- I've invested 8 years, maybe sunk cost fallacy


Dumb Things Begin wants to DO:
---
 - how many many VMs deep can I go, virtualbox
 - Docker Swarm something
 - Send an S3 Object around with object replication
   put it one bucket and setup a chain of buckets around the world
   with replication. Bucket Chain




SketchyScripts:
  hey give me some SSH keys to your new computer


Here is my VScode beef:
---
  - people suggest to use VSCODe, and they don't how it works
    how do you manage your virtaulkk


Vscode also matters how you integrate your full work setup

New to Arch
----
 - how do you pronouce pacman??
   - pacman the game
   - pacman the uk drill drapper
   - tu-pac man


#### Bad ABC analogy

To inherit or to ABC (abstract base class):


Code School:
 -> class that produces instances of coders

 (code school, creates instances of coders)
 class Coder:
   def code
   def document
   def snack
   def wfh

coder = Coder()

coder = DataScientist()

coder = PartTimeLifeCoach()

ABC -> job description -> api -> you need to be able to do

class ABCoder():
   def code
   def document
   def snack
   def wfh


def big_company(coder):

  if coder is abc.ABCoder:
	  while alive:
	     coder.code()







Lambda Opinions
---
- is your work super async, time-insensitive, lambda will be all good for you

Code School Practice Everyone should Adopt
---
- whenever anyone got up, someone would delete all your code.
- forced you to use git, and push



New Bands
----
Vulnerable VMs - Early Punk / Emo - Rites of Spring, we sing our emotions
                                    in increasingly virtualized world, the
				    discomfort and comfort
