Viewer Questions
================
- I know Java, how different than python:
  - You got it, they both OO
  - Similiar options for pacakages
  - There are different philosphies, and I would suggest, you try and adopt the pythonista ways, embrace the python.
  - If you are paid for Java you can get paid for Python

Questions
=========

Learnings
=========

- Custom metaclasses inherit from `type`, which is metaclass
- The signature of the init, looks like this:

```
def __init__(cls, name, bases, attr_dict):
```

the first idiomatically cls, NOT self, to signal to people
this is a metaclass


 This was illuminating to me (about the order of adjectives in English): “absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that order in the slightest you’ll sound like a maniac.”

Ponderings
==========


You are having a problem
Identify some concepts you don't understand
Stop solving, learn for a bit
then try again
repeat
