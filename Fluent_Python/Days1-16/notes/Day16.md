Questions
---------
  * HOF
    - Some take in Functions as Args
    - Some returns functions
    - Some do Both
    - Are there 3 distinct names
  * How are opcodes interupted by Cpython
  * Methods versus Functions
      - Methods means on an instance of something?
  * Name the 7 Callable Types in Python!!!
    - User-defined functions
    - Built-in functions - C
    - Built-in methods - C
    - methods - Not C? User-defined??
    - Classes
    - Class instances - If a class defines a __call__ method,
      then its instances may be invoked as functions.
    - Generator functions - Functions or methods that use the yield keyword. When called, generator functions return a generator object.



Learnings
---------
  * `word[::-1]` reverses a word!
  * the body of a lambda cannot make assignments or use any other
    Python statement such as while, try, etc.
  * Outside the limited context of arguments to higher-order functions,
    anonymous functions are rarely useful in Python.
    The syntactic restrictions tend to make nontrivial
    lambdas either unreadable or unworkable.
  * If you find a piece of code hard to understand because of a lambda,
    Fredrik Lundh suggests this refactoring procedure:
      - Write a comment explaining what the heck that lambda does.
      - Study the comment for a while, and think of a name that captures the essence of the comment.
      - Convert the lambda to a def statement, using that name.
      - Remove the comment.
