================================
Frameworks:
  - Django
  - React
  - Vue

Mininimal Build Up Approach:

- if someone tries to msake me learn C++, Ima use Rust

Is C is faster than Rust?



How long are peoples test suites?
How long are peoples compile times?

Development depends on hardware also


Does Rust compile too slow to work in?
