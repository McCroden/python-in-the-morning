    # result = await loop.run_in_executor(
    #     None, blocking_io)
    # print('default thread pool', result)

    # 2. Run in a custom thread pool:
    # with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as pool:
    #     result = await loop.run_in_executor(
    #         pool, blocking_io)
    #     print('custom thread pool', result)

    # # 3. Run in a custom process pool:
