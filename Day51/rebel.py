# I think we should start a movement to break PEP 8:


# Anti-PEP-8 Manifesto:
#    classes and functions are interchangable
#    the arbitary stylistic division between classes (uppper CamelCase)
#    and functions (classy snakecase), is keeping us divided as
#    a python community, and we are losing valuable refactoring
#    as a result.
